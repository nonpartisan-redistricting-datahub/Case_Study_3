# Case Study: Combining Election Results with Precinct Boundaries to Draw and Analyze Proposed Redistricting Plans

This is the code that accompanies the Case Study of our aggregation data work with Maine Votes. 

You can find a write up of that Case Study on our website [redistrictingdatahub.org](ADD LINK HERE).

## Getting Started

### Data
- [VEST 2020 Precinct Boundary and Election Results](https://redistrictingdatahub.org/dataset/vest-2020-maine-precinct-boundaries-and-election-results-shapefile/)
- [VEST 2018 Precinct Boundary and Election Results](https://redistrictingdatahub.org/dataset/vest-2018-maine-precinct-and-election-results/)
- Mapping from Precinct to Town for 2018 and 2020 (by request, email info@redistrictingdatahub.org)
- 2018 and 2020 ME congressional results (by request, email info@redistrictingdatahub.org)
- [U.S. Census Cartographic Map](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html) (download "cb_2018_us_state_500k.zip")


#### Folder Structure
After making the name changes to the block-assignment files, you should create a "raw-from-source" and load in the above files. This file structure will allow you to run the notebook without making changes.

## Built With

We are used Python and Jupyter Notebook to show how we processed the data. We like Jupyter Notebook because it provides a very easy way to visualize the data as you are working.

# Case Study Helping a Redistricting Organization Get the Data They Need to Draw and Analyze Proposed Plans

This is the code that accompanies the Case Study of our aggregation data work with Maine Votes. 

You can find a write up of that Case Study on our website [redistrictingdatahub.org](ADD LINK HERE).

## Getting Started

### Data


#### Folder Structure
After making the name changes to the block-assignment files, you should create a "raw-from-source" and load in the above files. This file structure will allow you to run the notebook without making changes.

## Questions

Send a message to the Redistricting Data Hub [Help Desk](https://redistrictingdatahub.org/tools/support/) at help@redistrictingdatahub.org with questions about this code, data and the redistricting process!

## Built With

We are used Python and Jupyter Notebook to show how we processed the data. We like Jupyter Notebook because it provides a very easy way to visualize the data as you are working.
